I am currently a freshman at Northwest Missouri State University working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science . I should be graduating next fall for my Masters.
I’m from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. It’s in India. I have completed my bachelor’s in Computer Science stream in SRK Institute of Technology, Affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Kakinada (JNTUK).This is my first time staying far away from home and I feel a little homesick. My hobbies are playing cricket, hanging out with my friends, exploring new places.
My goal is to create a web application on my own at the end of this course and I hope I could achieve this by the hands on experience provided by the Instructor.
